1.5 Overview 
The document is structured into sections detailing the functional and non-functional 
requirements, system features, external interface requirements, and more. 
2. Overall Description 
2.1 Product Perspective 
The Criminal Management System (CMS) is designed to function as an integrated 
component within the broader ecosystem of criminal justice systems. Its role is to centralize 
and streamline processes that are traditionally managed through disparate tools and manual 
methods. CMS is intended to replace or complement existing systems, offering enhanced 
capabilities and greater efficiency. 
2.2 Product Functions 
User Authentication and Authorization: Secure login and role-based access control. 
Criminal Data Management: Entry, editing, deletion, and retrieval of criminal records. 
Case Management: Management of criminal cases, including evidence, and case progression. 
Evidence and Document Management: upload, storage, and retrieval of digital evidence and 
documents. 
Reporting and Analytics: Generation of reports and analysis of crime trends, case statistics, and 
resource allocation. 
2.3 User Classes and Characteristics 
Law Enforcement Officers: Use the system to manage criminal records and cases. 
Legal Professionals: Access evidence and case documents, schedule court proceedings. 
System Administrators: Manage user accounts, system configurations, and security protocols. 
2.4 Operating Environment
